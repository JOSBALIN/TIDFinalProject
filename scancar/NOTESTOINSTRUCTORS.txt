Hello dear instructors,

Thank you for taking the time to look at our work.

Admittedly, we have not gotten very far (yet). However, we hope you enjoy what we have managed to do.

We are particularly interested in feedback/help regarding how to best style CSS elements in regards to sizes.
Both font sizes, width and heights of elements, and so on.

Our Figma prototype used absolute styling (pixels), and unfortunately that isn't always feasible when developing responsively.
How should this be tackled? What's the best method to determine what kind of size scale to use? (%, em, so on)
And what's the "limit" of responsiveness you expect? Do we need to scale all the way down to 600x400 windows?
Or can we fairly limit to 16:9 displays? (given we are targeting PC use)

Thank you for your help :)
